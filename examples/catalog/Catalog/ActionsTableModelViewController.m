// What's going on in this file:
//
// This is a demo of handling actions in a UITableView.
//
// The NITableViewActions object attaches blocks to objects in three contexts: tapping, navigating,
// and detail actions. Any combination of these three blocks may be attached to a given object.
// The actions object will automatically update the accessory type of the cell when it is displayed
// so that it shows the correct accessory type for the available actions.
//
// You will find the following Nimbus features used:
//
// [models]
// NITableViewModel
// NITableViewActions
//
// This controller requires the following frameworks:
//
// Foundation.framework
// UIKit.framework
//

@interface ActionsTableModelViewController ()
@property (nonatomic, retain) NITableViewModel* model;

// The actions are stored in a separate object from the model.
@property (nonatomic, retain) NITableViewActions* actions;
@end
