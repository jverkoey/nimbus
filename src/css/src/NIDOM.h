/**
 * A light-weight DOM-like object to which you attach views and stylesheets.
 *
 * @ingroup NimbusCSS
 *
 * To be clear: this is not an HTML DOM, but its intent is the same. NIDOM is designed
 * to simplify the view <=> stylesheet relationship. Add a view to the DOM and it will
 * automatically apply any applicable styles from the attached stylesheet. If the stylesheet
 * changes you can refresh the DOM and all registered views will be updated accordingly.
 *
 * Because NimbusCSS supports positioning and sizing using percentages and relative units,
 * the order of view registration is important. Generally, you should register superviews
 * first, so that any size calculations on their children can occur after their own
 * size has been determined. It's not feasible (or at least advisable) to try and
 * untangle these dependencies automatically.
 *
 * <h2>Example Use</h2>
 *
 * NIDOM is most useful when you create a single NIDOM per view controller.
 *
@code
NIStylesheet* stylesheet = [stylesheetCache stylesheetWithPath:@"root/root.css"];
// Create a NIDOM object in your view controller.
_dom = [[NIDOM alloc] initWithStylesheet:stylesheet];
@endcode
 *
 * You then register views in the DOM during loadView or viewDidLoad.
 *
@code
// Registers a view by itself such that only "UILabel" rulesets will apply.
[_dom registerView:_label];

// Register a view with a specific CSS class. Any rulesets with the ".background" scope will
// apply to this view.
[_dom registerView:self.view withCSSClass:@"background"];
@endcode
 *
 * Once the view controller unloads its view you must unregister all of the views from your DOM.
 *
@code
- (void)viewDidUnload {
  [_dom unregisterAllViews];
}
@endcode
