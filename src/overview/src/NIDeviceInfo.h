 *
 * This class is not meant to be instantiated. All methods are class implementations.
 *
 * This class aims to simplify the interface for collecting device information. The low-level
 * mach APIs provide a host of valuable information but it's often in formats that aren't
 * particularly ready for presentation.
 *
 *      @attention When using this class on the simulator, the values returned will reflect
 *                 those of the computer within which you're running the simulator, not the
 *                 simulated device. This is because the simulator is a first-class citizen
 *                 on the computer and has full access to your RAM and disk space.
