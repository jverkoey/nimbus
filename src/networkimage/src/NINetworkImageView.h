 * The resulting image size will exactly match the display size.

/**

 *
 * <h3>Two basic methods for setting the display size of the network image</h3>
 *
 * @code
 *  UIImage* image; // some previously loaded image.
 *  NINetworkImageView* imageView = [[[NINetworkImageView alloc] initWithImage:image] autorelease];
 *
 *  // Method #1: Use the image's frame to determine the display size for the network image.
 *  imageView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100);
 *  [imageView setPathToNetworkImage:@"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1165/644335254_4b8a712be5.jpg"];
 *
 *  // Method #2: use the method setPathToNetworkImage:forDisplaySize:
 *  [imageView setPathToNetworkImage: @"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1165/644335254_4b8a712be5.jpg"
 *                    forDisplaySize: CGSizeMake(100, 100)];
 * @endcode
 *
 * <i>Code Breakdown</i>
 *
 * @code
 *  NINetworkImageView* imageView = [[[NINetworkImageView alloc] initWithImage:image] autorelease];
 * @endcode
 *
 * Initializes the network image view with a preloaded image, usually a "default" image
 * to be displayed until the network image downloads.
 *
 * @code
 *  imageView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100);
 *  [imageView setPathToNetworkImage:@"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1165/644335254_4b8a712be5.jpg"];
 * @endcode
 *
 * We must take care to set the frame before requesting the network image, otherwise the
 * image's display size will be 0,0 and the network image won't be cropped or sized to fit.
 *
 * @code
 *  [imageView setPathToNetworkImage: @"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1165/644335254_4b8a712be5.jpg"
 *                    forDisplaySize: CGSizeMake(100, 100)];
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you don't want to modify the frame of the image, you can alternatively specify
 * the display size as a parameter to the setPathToNetworkImage: method.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Use a different contentMode for the network image.</h3>
 *
 * @code
 *  UIImage* image; // some previously loaded image.
 *  NINetworkImageView* imageView = [[[NINetworkImageView alloc] initWithImage:image] autorelease];
 *
 *  imageView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100);
 *  imageView.contentMode = UIViewContentModeCenter; // Centers the image in the frame.
 *  [imageView setPathToNetworkImage: @"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1165/644335254_4b8a712be5.jpg"
 *                       contentMode: UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill];
 * @endcode
 *
 * <i>Code Breakdown</i>
 *
 * @code
 *  [imageView setPathToNetworkImage: @"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1165/644335254_4b8a712be5.jpg"
 *                       contentMode: UIViewContentModeScaleAspectFill];
 * @endcode
 *
 * This means: <i>after the image is downloaded, crop and resize the image with an aspect
 * fill content mode.</i>
 * The image returned from the thread will be cropped and sized to fit the imageView perfectly
 * at the given 100x100 dimensions.
 * Because imageView has a contentMode of UIViewContentModeCenter, if we were to make the
 * image view larger the downloaded image would stay in the center of the image view and
 * leave empty space on all sides.
