/**
 * A simple message view controller implementation.
 *
 *      @ingroup NimbusMessageController
 *
 *
 * <h2>Subclassing</h2>
 *
 * This view controller implements UIWebViewDelegate. If you want to
 * implement methods of this delegate then you should take care to call the super implementation
 * if necessary. The following UIViewWebDelegate methods have implementations in this class:
 *
 * @code
 * - webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType:
 * - webViewDidStartLoad:
 * - webViewDidFinishLoad:
 * - webView:didFailLoadWithError:
 * @endcode
 *
 * This view controller also implements UIActionSheetDelegate. If you want to implement methods of
 * this delegate then you should take care to call the super implementation if necessary. The
 * following UIActionSheetDelegate methods have implementations in this class:
 *
 * @code
 * - actionSheet:clickedButtonAtIndex:
 * - actionSheet:didDismissWithButtonIndex:
 * @endcode
 *
 * In addition to the above methods of the UIActionSheetDelegate, this view controller also provides
 * the following method, which is invoked prior to presenting the internal action sheet to the user
 * and allows subclasses to customize the action sheet or even reject to display it (and provide their
 * own handling instead):
 *
 * @code
 * - shouldPresentActionSheet:
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h2>Recommended Configurations</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Default</h3>
 *
 * The default settings will create a toolbar with the default tint color, which is normally
 * light blue on the iPhone and gray on the iPad.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Colored Toolbar</h3>
 *
 * The following settings will change the toolbar tint color (in this case black)
 *
 * @code
 *  [webController setToolbarTintColor:[UIColor blackColor]];
 * @endcode
