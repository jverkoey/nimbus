/**
 * A simple factory for creating collection view cells from objects.
 *
 * This factory provides a single method that accepts an object and returns a UICollectionViewCell
 * for use in a UICollectionView. A cell will only be returned if the object passed to the factory
 * conforms to the NICollectionViewCellObject protocol. The created cell should ideally conform to
 * the NICollectionViewCell protocol. If it does, the object will be passed to it via
 * @link NICollectionViewCell::shouldUpdateCellWithObject: shouldUpdateCellWithObject:@endlink
 * before the factory method returns.
 *
 * This factory is designed to be used with NICollectionViewModel, though one could easily use
 * it with other collection view data source implementations simply by providing nil for the
 * collection view model argument.
 *
 * If you instantiate an NICollectionViewCellFactory then you can provide explicit mappings from
 * objects to cells. This is helpful if the effort required to implement the NICollectionViewCell
 * protocol on an object outweighs the benefit of using the factory, i.e. when you want to map
 * simple types such as NSString to cells.

/**
 * Creates a cell from a given object if and only if the object conforms to the

 *
 * This method signature matches the NICollectionViewModelDelegate method so that you can
 * set this factory as the model's delegate:
 *
 * @code
// Must cast to id to avoid compiler warnings.
_model.delegate = (id)[NICollectionViewCellFactory class];
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you would like to customize the factory's output, implement the model's delegate method
 * and call the factory method. Remember that if the factory doesn't know how to map
 * the object to a cell it will return nil.
