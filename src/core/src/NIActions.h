/**
 * The NIActions class provides a generic interface for attaching actions to objects.
 *
 * The three primary types of actions are:
 *
 * - buttons,
 * - detail views,
 * - and pushing a new controller onto the navigation controller.
 *
 * <h3>Attaching Actions</h3>
 *
 * Actions may be attached to specific instances of objects or to entire classes of objects. When
 * an action is attached to both a class of object and an instance of that class, only the instance
 * action should be executed.
 *
 * All attachment methods return the object that was provided. This makes it simple to attach
 * actions within an array creation statement.
 *
 * Actions come in two forms: blocks and selector invocations. Both can be attached to an object
 * for each type of action and both will be executed, with the block being executed first. Blocks
 * should be used for simple executions while selectors should be used when the action is complex.
 *
 * The following is an example of using NITableViewActions:
 *
@code
NSArray *objects = @[
  [NITitleCellObject objectWithTitle:@"Implicit tap handler"],
  [self.actions attachToObject:[NITitleCellObject objectWithTitle:@"Explicit tap handler"]
                      tapBlock:
   ^BOOL(id object, id target) {
     NSLog(@"Object was tapped with an explicit action: %@", object);
   }]
];

[self.actions attachToClass:[NITitleCellObject class]
                   tapBlock:
 ^BOOL(id object, id target) {
   NSLog(@"Object was tapped: %@", object);
 }];
@endcode
 *
