 * @{
 *
 * Non-retaining collections have historically been used when we needed more than one delegate
 * in an object. However, NSNotificationCenter is a much better solution for n > 1 delegates.
 * Using a non-retaining collection is dangerous, so if you must use one, use it with extreme care.
 * The danger primarily lies in the fact that by all appearances the collection should still
 * operate like a regular collection, so this might lead to a lot of developer error if the
 * developer assumes that the collection does, in fact, retain the object.
