/**
 * For classic computer science data structures.
 *
 * iOS provides most of the important data structures such as arrays, dictionaries, and sets.
 * However, it is missing some lesser-used data structures such as linked lists. Nimbus makes
 * use of the linked list data structure to provide an efficient, least-recently-used cache
 * removal policy for its in-memory cache, NIMemoryCache.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Comparison of Data Structures</h2>
 *
 *<pre>
 *  Requirement           | NILinkedList | NSArray | NSSet | NSDictionary
 *  =====================================================================
 *  Instant arbitrary     |     YES      |   NO    |  YES  |     YES
 *  insertion/deletion    |     [1]      |         |       |
 *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Consistent object     |     YES      |   YES   |  NO   |     NO
 *  ordering              |              |         |       |
 *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Checking for object   |     NO       |   NO    |  YES  |     NO
 *  existence quickly     |              |         |       |
 *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Instant object access |     YES      |   NO    |  YES  |     YES
 *                        |     [1]      |         |       |     [2]
 *  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
 *
 * - [1] Note that being able to instantly remove and access objects in a NILinkedList
 *       requires additional overhead of maintaining NILinkedListLocation objects in your
 *       code. If this is your only requirement, then it's likely simpler to use an NSSet.
 *       A linked list <i>is</i> worth using if you also need consistent ordering, seeing
 *       as neither NSSet nor NSDictionary provide this.
 * - [2] This assumes you are accessing the object with its key.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Why NILinkedList was Built</h2>
 *
 * NILinkedList was built to solve a specific need in Nimbus' in-memory caches of having
 * a collection that guaranteed ordering, constant-time appending, and constant
 * time removal of arbitrary objects.
 * NSArray does not guarantee constant-time removal of objects, NSSet does not enforce ordering
 * (though the new NSOrderedSet introduced in iOS 5 does), and NSDictionary also does not
 * enforce ordering.

/**
 * A singly linked list implementation.
 *
 * This data structure provides constant time insertion and deletion of objects
 * in a collection.
 *
 * A linked list is different from an NSMutableArray solely in the runtime of adding and
 * removing objects. It is always possible to remove objects from both the beginning and end of
 * a linked list in constant time, contrasted with an NSMutableArray where removing an object
 * from the beginning of the list could result in O(N) linear time, where
 * N is the number of objects in the collection when the action is performed.
 * If an object's location is known, it is possible to get O(1) constant time removal
 * with a linked list, where an NSMutableArray would get at best O(N) linear time.
 *
 * This collection implements NSFastEnumeration which allows you to use foreach-style
 * iteration on the linked list. If you would like more control over the iteration of the
 * linked list you can use
 * <code>-[NILinkedList @link NILinkedList::objectEnumerator objectEnumerator@endlink]</code>
 *
 *
 * <h2>When You Should Use a Linked List</h2>
 *
 * Linked lists should be used when you need guaranteed constant-time performance characteristics
 * for adding arbitrary objects to and removing arbitrary objects from a collection that
 * also enforces consistent ordering.
 *
 * Linked lists are used in NIMemoryCache to implement an efficient, least-recently used
 * collection for in-memory caches. It is important that these caches use a collection with
 * guaranteed constant-time properties because in-memory caches must operate as fast as
 * possible in order to avoid locking up the UI. Specifically, in-memory caches could
 * potentially have thousands of objects. Every time we access one of these objects we move
 * its lru placement to the end of the lru list. If we were to use an NSArray for this data
 * structure we could easily run into an O(N^2) exponential-time operation which is
 * absolutely unacceptable.

 * @class NILinkedList
 *
 * <h2>Modifying a linked list</h2>
 *
 * To add an object to a linked list, you may use @link NILinkedList::addObject: addObject:@endlink.
 *
 * @code
 *  [ll addObject:object];
 * @endcode
 *
 * To remove some arbitrary object in linear time (meaning we must perform a scan of the list), use
 * @link NILinkedList::removeObject: removeObject:@endlink
 *
 * @code
 *  [ll removeObject:object];
 * @endcode
 *
 * Note that using a linked list in this way is way is identical to using an
 * NSMutableArray in performance time.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Accessing a Linked List</h2>
 *
 * You can access the first and last objects with constant time by using
 * @link NILinkedList::firstObject firstObject@endlink and
 * @link NILinkedList::lastObject lastObject@endlink.
 *
 * @code
 *  id firstObject = ll.firstObject;
 *  id lastObject = ll.lastObject;
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h2>Traversing a Linked List</h2>
 *
 * NILinkedList implements the NSFastEnumeration protocol, allowing you to use foreach-style
 * iteration over the objects of a linked list. Note that you cannot modify a linked list
 * during fast iteration and doing so will fire an assertion.
 *
 * @code
 *  for (id object in ll) {
 *    // perform operations on the object
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If you need to modify the linked list while traversing it, an acceptable algorithm is to
 * successively remove either the head or tail object, depending on the order in which you wish
 * to traverse the linked list.
 *
 * <h3>Traversing Forward by Removing Objects from the List</h3>
 *
 * @code
 *  while (nil != ll.firstObject) {
 *    id object = [ll firstObject];
 *
 *    // Remove the head of the linked list in constant time.
 *    [ll removeFirstObject];
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * <h3>Traversing Backward by Removing Objects from the List</h3>
 *
 * @code
 *  while (nil != ll.lastObject) {
 *    id object = [ll lastObject];
 *
 *    // Remove the tail of the linked list in constant time.
 *    [ll removeLastObject];
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Building a first-in-first-out list of operations</h3>
 *
 * @code
 *  NILinkedList* ll = [NILinkedList linkedList];
 *
 *  // Add the operations to the linked list like you would an array.
 *  [ll addObject:operation1];
 *
 *  // Each addObject call appends the object to the end of the linked list.
 *  [ll addObject:operation2];
 *
 *  while (nil != ll.firstObject) {
 *    NSOperation* op1 = [ll firstObject];
 *    // Process the operation...
 *
 *    // Remove the head of the linked list in constant time.
 *    [ll removeFirstObject];
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * <h3>Removing an item from the middle of the list</h3>
 *
 * @code
 *  NILinkedList* ll = [NILinkedList linkedList];
 *
 *  [ll addObject:obj1];
 *  [ll addObject:obj2];
 *  [ll addObject:obj3];
 *  [ll addObject:obj4];
 *
 *  // Find an object in the linked list in linear time.
 *  NILinkedListLocation* location = [ll locationOfObject:obj3];
 *
 *  // Remove the object in constant time.
 *  [ll removeObjectAtLocation:location];
 *
 *  // Location is no longer valid at this point.
 *  location = nil;
 *
 *  // Remove an object in linear time. This is simply a more concise version of the above.
 *  [ll removeObject:obj4];
 *
 *  // We would use the NILinkedListLocation to remove the object if we were storing the location
 *  // in an external data structure and wanted constant time removal, for example. See
 *  // NIMemoryCache for an example of this in action.
 * @endcode
 *
 *      @sa NIMemoryCache
 *
 *
 * <h3>Using the location object for constant time operations</h3>
 *
 * @code
 *  NILinkedList* ll = [NILinkedList linkedList];
 *
 *  [ll addObject:obj1];
 *  NILinkedListLocation* location = [ll addObject:obj2];
 *  [ll addObject:obj3];
 *  [ll addObject:obj4];
 *
 *  // Remove the second object in constant time.
 *  [ll removeObjectAtLocation:location];
 *
 *  // Location is no longer valid at this point.
 *  location = nil;
