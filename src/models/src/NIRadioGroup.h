/**
 * A general-purpose radio group.
 *
 * This group object manages radio-style selection of objects. Only one object may be selected at
 * a time.
 *
 * Due to the general-purpose nature of this object, it can be used with UITableViews or any other
 * view that has sets of objects being displayed. This object can insert itself into a
 * UITableViewDelegate call chain to minimize the amount of code that needs to be written in your
 * controller.
 *
 * If you add a NIRadioGroup object to a NITableViewModel, it will show a cell that displays the
 * current radio group selection. This cell is also tappable. Tapping this cell will push a
 * controller onto the navigation stack that presents the radio group options for the user to
 * select. The radio group delegate is notified immediately when a selection is made and the
 * tapped cell is also updated to reflect the new selection.
