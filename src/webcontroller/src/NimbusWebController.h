 *
 * This controller presents a UIWebView with a toolbar containing basic chrome for interacting
 * with it. The chrome shows forward, back, stop and refresh buttons on a toolbar aligned
 * to the bottom of the view controller's view. The toolbar includes an option to open the
 * URL in Safari. If the controller is shown in a navigation controller, self.title will
 * show the current web page's title. A spinner will be shown in the navigation bar's right
 * bar button area if there are any active requests.
