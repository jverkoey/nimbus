 * This Nimbus badge view is a UIView that draws a customizable notification badge-like view.
 *
 * @image html badge-iphone-example1.png "Screenshot of a Nimbus badge on the iPhone"
 *
 * <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
 *
 * Required frameworks:
 *
 * - Foundation.framework
 * - UIKit.framework
 *
 * Minimum Operating System: <b>iOS 4.0</b>
 *
 * Source located in <code>src/badge/src</code>
 *
@code
#import "NimbusBadge.h"
@endcode
 *
 * <h2>Basic Use</h2>
 *
 * The badge view works much like UILabel. Once you've assigned text and configured the attributes
 * you should call sizeToFit to have the badge determine its ideal size.
 *
@code
NIBadgeView* badgeView = [[NIBadgeView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];
badgeView.text = @"7";
[badgeView sizeToFit];
[self.view addSubview:badgeView];
@endcode
 *
 * @}
